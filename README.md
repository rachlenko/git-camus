## Git-camus
**git-Camus:** Craft Git Commit Messages with Existential Flair 

## SYNOPSIS

_git-camus_  
## DESCRIPTION

**git-camus** is a tool that transforms your Git commit messages into philosophical reflections inspired by the works of [**Albert Camus**.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) Instead of mundane messages, each commit becomes a thoughtful meditation on absurdity, rebellion, and the human condition. Ideal for developers who wish to bring a deeper existential meaning to their codebase, **git-camus** turns the ordinary act of version control into an exploration of life's paradoxes.
