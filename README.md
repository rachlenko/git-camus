# Git-Camus: Craft Git Commit Messages with Existential Flair

[![Python package](https://github.com/rachlenko/git-camus/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rachlenko/git-camus/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)

**git-camus** transforms your Git commit messages into philosophical reflections inspired by the works of [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus). Instead of mundane messages, each commit becomes a thoughtful meditation on absurdity, rebellion, and the human condition.

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install git-camus

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/rachlenko/git-camus.git
cd git-camus
pip install -e .
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- A valid Anthropic API key with access to Claude models

## Setup

Set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# For Windows (Command Prompt)
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# For Windows (PowerShell)
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

You can add this to your shell profile for persistence.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Stage your changes first
git add .

# Then use git-camus instead of git commit
git-camus
```

This will analyze your staged changes, generate a philosophical commit message inspired by Camus, and commit the changes.

### Show Message Without Committing

```bash
git-camus --show
```

This displays the generated commit message without actually committing.

### Provide Context

You can provide an original commit message as context:

```bash
git-camus --message "Fix authentication bug"
```

The tool will consider your original message when generating the philosophical version.

## Examples

Here are some example commit messages generated by git-camus:

- "Refactor authentication: in the face of the absurd, we must persist"
- "Fix pagination logic, acknowledging the futility of infinite scrolling"
- "Add unit tests, for in testing we confront our code's mortality"
- "Document API endpoints - maps for navigating our digital Sisyphean task"

## Why Git-Camus?

- **Stand Out**: Make your commit history a philosophical journey
- **Self-Reflection**: Turn the mundane act of committing code into an exploration of deeper meaning
- **Conversation Starter**: Spark interesting discussions during code reviews
- **Learning**: Subtly introduce your team to existentialist philosophy

## Configuration

Git-Camus uses sensible defaults, but you can customize it by creating a `.git-camus.toml` file in your project root or home directory:

```toml
[api]
model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"  # Claude model to use
max_tokens = 150                     # Maximum tokens in response
temperature = 0.7                    # Creativity level (0.0-1.0)

[style]
philosopher = "camus"                # Currently only supports "camus"
```
